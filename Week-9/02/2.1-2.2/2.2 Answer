Q.
Change the script so that the SmartPhone is created with the line:
Mobilephone myPhone = new Smartphone();
Compile your code again. Are there any problems? Why do this problems happen? What are the possible
solutions?

A. 
Using Mobilephone myPhone = new SmartPhone(); means that the object
can no longer use the methods in SmartPhone. This is because
myPhone is of type Mobilephone, which is not an Abstract class.

Could solve this by making Mobilephone an interface or
Abstract Class
