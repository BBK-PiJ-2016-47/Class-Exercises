a)

What number would the following method print on screen if you called printNumbers(6)?

	void printNumbers(int n) {
		if (n <= 0) {
			return;
		}
		printLine(n);
		printNumbers(n-2);
		printNumbers(n-3);
		printLine(n);
	}


Do this exercise on paper. Then add this method to a Java Decaf program 
and check your answer.


Answer:

6
4
2
2
1
1
4
3
1
1

6


b)
Do you see anything wrong with the following code? How would you fix it?

	String buggyMethod(int n) {
		if (n == 0) {
			return "";
		}
		return n + " " + buggyMethod(n - 2);
	}

Answer:
Could become an infinite recursive loop as (1-2) does not equal 0, and so the method will
run forever with minus numbers.
