Q.
Read the following code and, without executing it first, explain what it does.
int currentYear = 2012
print "When were you born (year)?"
String str = System.console().readLine();
int birthYear = Integer.parseInt(str);
int ageAprox = currentYear - birthYear;
String result = (ageAprox > 17) ? "" : "not "
println "It seems you are " + result + "an adult."

A.
Asks for the year someone was born, takes that from the current year and tells the user that they are an adult if they're older than 17
and not an adult if they're younger.
