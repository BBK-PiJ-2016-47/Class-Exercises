Look at the following code. What does it do? What will it print on the screen?
double d1 = 1.255
double d2 = d1 + 7 - 4 - 3
if (d1 == d2) {
println("1.255 is equal to 1.255 plus 7 minus 7");
} else {
println("1.255 is NOT equal to 1.255 plus 7 minus 7");
}
Execute the program. Does it print what you expected it to print? Why? (Hint: print the value of d1 and d2;
why do they have these values?). If the program is not behaving correctly, fix it.


A.
Expected to print that it was not equal as rounding errors after arithmetic.

Updated code:

double d1 = 1.255
double d2 = d1 + 7 - 4 - 3
  if (Math.abs(d1 - d2) < 10E-6) {
    println("1.255 is equal to 1.255 plus 7 minus 7");
  } else {
    println("1.255 is NOT equal to 1.255 plus 7 minus 7");
  }
