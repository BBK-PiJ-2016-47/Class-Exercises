/*
Text2number
Write a program that reads a number with commas and decimal dots (such as 
“23,419.34”) and then prints a number that is half of it. Do not use 
Double.parseDouble(). If you were writing a simple spreadsheet, 
you could use this code to parse the input in the cells.

print "Please enter a number: "
String num = System.console().readLine();
int size = num.length();

num = num.replace(",","");

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
	if (num.charAt(i) == ) {
  
  }
