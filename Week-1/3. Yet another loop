Q.
What does the following piece of code do?

String str = System.console().readLine()
int i = Integer.parseInt(str)
while (i < 10) {
  i++;
  str = System.console().readLine()
  int j = Integer.parseInt(str)
  if (j == 0) {
    break;
  } else if (j != 1) {
    println j;
  }
}
println "finished"
Hint: the reserved word break exits the current loop.

A.
Takes a number from the input and while it is less than 10 it adds 1 to it.
Then takes another number from the input. If that number is 0 then the while loop is exited and the program says it is finished. 
If it is not 1, then it prints that number.
